This Java client-server application is designed to help you learn about sockets, streams, and buffers. The application consists of two main components:

    Server: A server program that listens for incoming client connections, receives messages from clients, processes them, and sends responses back.
    Client: A client program that connects to the server, sends messages to the server, and displays the responses received from the server.

Features

    Establishes a connection between the client and server using sockets.
    Sends and receives messages between the client and server using input and output streams.
    Utilizes buffered readers and writers for efficient reading and writing of data.
Notes

    Make sure the server is running before starting the client.
    You can customize the server port and host address in the code if needed.
    Experiment with different types of messages and observe how they are transmitted between the client and server.
